## Summary

This analysis is conducted on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) data obtained from the World Bank database [here](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/sustainable-development-goals-(sdgs)). We selected the data for 10 countries (5 African and 5 South American Countries) with 3 _indicators_: `Access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking`, `Access to electricity`, and `Access to electricity, rural` with a view to see how these indicators are connected and how the two continents perform against each other.
I did some data cleaning in Excel before importing into R.
I performed **Descriptive Analysis (Mean, Median, Standard Deviation, Skewness, Kurtosis,)**, **Correlation Analysis**, **Regression Analysis**, and **Time Series Analysis** on the cleaned data.
I also carried out a comparison of the _indicators_ for _Africa_ against _South America_.
